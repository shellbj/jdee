<h1>Contributed Software and Documentation</h1>

<p>The following is a list of Java development tools contributed
by JDE users. You are free to download and use these tools as you
see fit. If you have any questions regarding contributed tools,
please contact the authors or post your queries to the <a
href="mailto:jde@sunsite.auc.dk">JDE mailing list</a>. </p>

<h2>Ponce's Java Utilities</h2>

<h3>JMaker</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dponce.com/downloads/jmaker-2.1.zip">jmaker.el</a> library defines
a command that generates a makefile with targets for all Java
source files in the current directory. You can use the JDE build
command to run the generated makefile and thereby build all files
in the current directory. The library also defines a command that
generates a makefile to build all files in a directory tree by
invoking a makefile in each subdirectory.</p>

<h3>JSee </h3>

<p>The <a href="contrib/jsee.el">jsee.el</a> package generates
and displays the API documentation of the Java file in the
current buffer. </p>

<p>Contributed by <a href="mailto:David.Ponce@wanadoo.fr">David
Ponce.</a> You can also obtain the latest version of these
utilities from <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/david.ponce/">Ponce's
home page</a>.</p>


<h2>JDEE Interface to Lint for Java</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://home.nc.rr.com/nascifandelaine/emacs.html">jde-lint</a>
package, developed by Nascif Abousalh-Neto, provides an interface between the JDEE 
and the <a href="http://www.jutils.com/">Lint4j</a> ("Lint for Java") 
is a static Java source code analyzer that detects locking and threading issues and 
performance and scalability problems, and checks complex contracts such as 
Java serialization by performing type, data flow, and lock graph analysis.</p>

The jde-lint package uses the information from your JDEE project 
(sourcepath, classpath and package name) to run the lint4j tool and 
present the result in a compilation buffer.


<h2>GNU Make Documentation</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/contrib/make_winhelp.zip">make.hlp</a> file lets
you view documentation for the GNU make utility in Microsoft's
Winhelp viewer.</p>

<h2>JSerial </h2>

<p>The <a href="contrib/jserial.el">jserial.el</a> package
generates a Java serialver statement by invoking the
serialver or other specified program. The package name  is
gained from the source code. There are two main commands:
jserial-insert-serial-statement and
jserial-update-serial-statement. The first  inserts a
statement into a class that does not already have one. If a
statement is found an error is reported, and the second version
must be used. Similiarly the second function work only when a
serialver statement already exists. The package has been coded
this way for security. These statements should not be updated
accidentally as this has implications for versioning of
classes.</p>

<h2>Printable (PDF) Version of the JDE User's Guide</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="contrib/jde-ug-content.pdf" >PDF version</a> of JDE User's Guide (for JDE-2.2.7)
  </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/contrib/jde-ug-texsource.tar.gz" >TeX version</a> of JDE User's Guide (for JDE-2.2.7)
  </li>

  </ul>
  
  <p>
  <a href="mailto:MMYNSTED@vha.com" >Mark Mynsted</a> used
   <a href="http://html2latex.sourceforge.net">html2latex</a>
  to convert the HTML version of the JDE User's Guide to TeX format.
  He then use LaTeX to generate the PDF version.

  <h2>Decompiler Interface</h2>
  
  <p><a href="contrib/decompile.el">decompile.el</a> is an elisp package that
  detects that Emacs has opened a class file, runs the class data through a
  decompiler, and then replaces the class data in the buffer with a Java
  source representation.  The package can optionally create an editable buffer,
  constructing a .java based name from the original .class based name, that is easily 
  saved to disk.</p>


  <p>To use, place decompile.el somewhere on your elisp path.  Place 
  (require 'decompile) in your .emacs file.</p>


  <p>The package is intended to be used with Jad, but if you have another 
  decompiler that obeys various assumptions built into decompile.el, 
  then you should be able to use it by changing the executable name and 
  command line option customisation variables.</p>


  <p>The source is originally based on a package that was written by Ingo 
  Koch, but I have modified it somewhat.  Note that the comments 
  identify Ingo as the maintainer.  I'm not sure how accurate this is 
  given that while the structure is much the same, I have almost 
  completely rewritten everything.</p>


  <p>It is not as complete as I would like.  Things that I would like to 
  do, or see done (hint hint), are:</p>

  <ul>
    
    <li>The package assumes the byte comes from a .class file on
   disk and therefore the .java buffer name can be constructed
   from this.  The byte code should be decompiled, and the
   .java buffer name constructed by parsing the source for the
   class declaration.</li>

   <li>The package demands that the decompiler output source code to
   standard out.  This should be made more flexible.</li>

   <li>There is a flag that, if set, means that the source code is placed
   in a buffer that is modifable, associated with a Java filename,
   and marked as modified.  The buffer isn't saved, so the Java file
   isn't written to.  The flag should be extended to include a third
   option to automatically save the reconstructed Java source.
   Some thought is needed, about what to do if the intended Java file
   already exists.</li>

   <li>I wish the programming style was less imperative, and more
   functional, by it's been a while, and my Lisp skills are rusty.</li>

   <li>I've seen another package that links with jar and zip files to
   automatically view Java source representations of the contained
   files.  When I have time, I'll steal the idea and put it here.</li>
   
 </ul>
