<h1>JDEE Installation Guide</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <em>JDEE Installation Guide</em>. This guide
shows you how to install the JDEE on Unix platforms (see <a
href="install.html#Unix Installation">Unix Installation</a>) and on Windows platforms (see
<em>Windows Installation</em> in <a href="install.html#Windows 95/98/NT Installation">English</a> or
<a href="http://www.aheil.de/texte/emacs.html">German</a>). 
See <a href="install.html#XEmacs Setup">XEmacs Setup</a> 
for information on configuring XEmacs to run the JDEE.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> If you are new to Emacs, you should read the
<i>Init File</i> section in the <i>Customization </i>section of
the online Emacs manual before attempting to install the JDEE. </p>

<h3><a name="Unix Installation">Unix Installation</a></h3>

<ol>
    <li>Install the JDEE files on your file system. <p>The Unix
        JDEE distribution file is a zipped tar file. The easiest
        way to install the JDEE files is to copy the distribution
        file to the directory where you want the JDEE to reside
        permanently. Then enter</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">gzip -cd jde-latest.tar.gz
            | tar xvf -</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>at the command line. This command will create a JDEE
        subdirectory in the current directory and copy the JDEE
        files and documentation to the newly created directory. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      Download the latest versions of Eric Ludlam's speedbar, eieio, 
      and semantic bovinator packages and install them on your system, 
      each in their own directory.

      <p>You can download these packages from 
         <a href="http://cedet.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.
      </p>

       <p><strong>Note</strong> Emacs and XEmacs include earlier versions of speedbar
         that are incompatible with the JDEE. You must delete the earlier version or
         ensure that it is not on the Emacs load path. Otherwise you will get a Lisp error 
         when trying to start Emacs.
       </p>

    </li>

    <li>
      Download the Emacs Lisp library package from the JDEE website in
      in <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.tar.gz">compressed
      tar</a> or <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.zip">zip</a>
      format. Uncompress and install the package in a convenient
      location, for example, in your Emacs site directory.<br><br>
      </li>

    <li>Update the Emacs Lisp load path.
        
        <p>You must tell Emacs where the JDEE and its required packages live. 
           You can do this by adding Lisp forms to
           your Emacs startup (<code>.emacs</code>) file that update the Emacs
           load-path variable, which lists the paths that Emacs
           searches when looking for Lisp packages required by
           commands that you execute. The following is an example of
           how to do this.</p>
        
        <p>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/jde/lisp"))</code><br>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/cedet/common"))</code><br>
      <code>(load-file (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/cedet/common/cedet.el"))</code><br>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/elib"))</code><br>
        </p>
   

    </li>
    <li>Ensure that the JDEE is loaded at Emacs startup. 

        <p>To ensure this, add the following line to your <code>.emacs</code> file: </p>
     
            <p><code>(require 'jde)</code></p>

        <p>Be sure to add this line after the line that updates
        the load path (see step 3).</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>  See <a href="_emacs_jde">minimal .emacs
        file</a> for an example of the minimal setup file
        required to run the JDEE with Emacs. </p>

    </li>

    <li>Compile the JDEE's Lisp files.

        <p>
          <strong>Note </strong> You do not have to compile the JDEE Lisp files
          to use the JDEE. However, compiling the files can reduce Emacs startup
          time and speed some operations.
        </p>

	<p>The easiest way to compile the files is to use the JDEE command
	   <code>jde-compile-jde</code>.

        <p>
	  The JDEE's lisp directory contains a makefile that compiles the JDE
          Lisp files.  The makefile assumes that you are using GNU Emacs
	  and that the packages required by the JDEE are installed in the same 
          directory as the JDEE package itself, i.e., the makefile assumes a directory
          structure similar to the following:
	</p>

<p>
<pre>
  site
    jde
    speedbar
    semantic
    elib
    eieio
</pre>
</p>
	<p>
	  If your installation does not fit these assumptions, edit the makefile to reflect
          your installation.
        </p>

	<p>If Emacs is not on your path, you can specify it on the make command line, e.g.,<p>
<p>
<pre>
make EMACS=d:/Applications/emacs/emacs.exe
</pre>
</p>

	  
    </li>

</ol>

Installation</a></h3>

<p>This section provides instructions for installing a full-featured
JDEE setup on Windows. This section includes instructions for
installing and integrating the following packages:</p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li>Emacs (see <a href="install.html#Installing Emacs">Installing Emacs</a>)</li>
    <li>Cygnus Unix utilities (see <a
        href="install.html#Installing Cygnus Unix Utilities">Installing
        Cygnus Unix Utilities</a>)</li>
    <li>JDK 1.2 (see <a href="install.html#Installing Java Tools">Installing

    <li>JDEE (see <a href="install.html#Installing the JDE">Installing the JDEE</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Installing Emacs">Installing Emacs</a></h4>

<ol>
    <li>Download the latest <a
        href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/latest ">precompiled
        version</a> of Emacs from the NT/Emacs ftp site. <p><b>Note</b>
        The distribution comes in zipped tar format. Tape archive
        (tar) format is a Unix file format for storing multiple
        files in a single file for archiving or transport to
        other systems. To unpack the Emacs distribution, you will
        need an unzip utility that can handle zipped tar files.
        The popular WinZip utility can handle zipped tar files.
        You can also use Windows versions of the Unix gzip and
        tar facilities to unzip and untar the Emacs distribution.
        You can find 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/utilities/i386">precompiled versions</a> 
	of the compression and archive utilities at the NT/Emacs site.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Unpack Emacs into a directory of your choice. <p>For
        example, I unpacked my copy into <tt>d:/emacs</tt></p>
        <p>You should find a file named README as a part of the
        distribution. Be sure to read this file for information
        on installing Emacs. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Register Emacs. <p>Let's assume that the directory in
        which you have unpacked Emacs is <tt>d:/emacs</tt>. First,
        run the program <code>addpm.exe</code> from the Emacs <code>bin</code>
        directory. The easiest way to do this is to open a
        Windows Explorer window on the <tt>bin</tt> directory (for
        example, <tt>d:\emacs\bin</tt>) and double-click the <tt>addpm.exe</tt>
        entry. Or you can invoke addpm.exe from a Windows command
        shell by entering, for example, the following lines: </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>cd d:\emacs\bin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
        <br>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; addpm.exe</tt> </p>
        <p>Invoking <tt>addpm.exe</tt> creates a set of registry
        keys that tell Emacs where to find its support files (lisp,
        info, etc.). It also creates a folder containing an icon
        linked to <tt>runemacs.exe</tt> (a wrapper program for
        invoking Emacs). </p>
        <p>Now, to run Emacs, simply click on the icon in the
        newly created folder or invoke <tt>runemacs.exe</tt> from
        a command prompt. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Create a home directory in your computer's filesystem.

      <p>The home directory is the directory where Emacs expects to
        find your Emacs startup file (see next step). The home
        directory is also where the bash shell (see <a
        href="install.html#Installing Cygnus Unix Utilities">Installing the Cygnus Unix
        Distribution</a>) expects to find the various startup
        files that it recognizes. Creating a home directory
        involves two steps. First, create the directory. It can
        be located anywhere you choose and can have any name. (I
        follow a pseudo Unix convention on my system by naming my
        home directory: <tt>c:\usr\home</tt>.). Then, create a
        HOME environment variable that points to the home
        directory. </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Creating a home directory is not a
        prerequisite to installing Emacs. If you do not specify a
        home directory via a HOME variable, Emacs assumes that
        your home directory is c:\. However, putting your startup
        file(s) in a separate directory makes them easier to
        manage. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Create an empty Emacs startup file in your home directory.
        <p>The startup file can be named either <tt>_emacs</tt>
        or <tt>.emacs</tt>. If you have both files in your home
        directory, Emacs will load the <tt>.emacs</tt> file and
        ignore <tt>_emacs</tt>. For more information on startup
        files, see <a
        href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html#startup">startup</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Create an Emacs add-on directory for storing Emacs Lisp
        packages that do not come with the core Emacs
        distribution, a prime example, being the JDE itself. <p>Some
        Emacs users simply dump add-on packages into the Emacs
        core lisp directory. However, it is better to keep add-on
        packages in a separate directory to avoid overwriting the
        add-on packages when you update the core distribution. On
        my system, the add-on directory is located at <tt>c:\usr\home\emacs\site</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>You must add the site directory to the Emacs load-path,
        i.e., the list of directories where Emacs searches for
        packages that you require. You do this by inserting at
        the head of your <tt>.emacs</tt> file Lisp code that
        prepends the site directory to the load path, e.g., </p>


<pre>    
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/jde/lisp"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/semantic"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/speedbar"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/elib"))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/eieio"))
</pre>

        <p>Note that, following Unix convention, NT/Emacs
        replaces the tilde (~) character in paths with the path
        of your home directory.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Set up Emacs to use a browser.</p>
    
      <p>See <a href="install.html#SpecifyingBrowser">Specifying a Browser</a>
      for information on configuring Emacs to use a browser.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Set up Emacs to emulate Windows editor key bindings and
        mouse selection mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>Emacs's default text selection mode and cut-and-paste key
bindings differ from the CUA standard used by Windows. (Hardly
surprising, as Emacs antedates both CUA and Windows). If you
prefer the CUA mode (as I do), you can configure Emacs to emulate
CUA mode. To do this, first copy the package <a
href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/contrib/cua-mode.el">cua-mode.el</a> into your Emacs site
directory (see step 6 above). Then, insert the following code
into your <tt>.emacs</tt> file (see step 5 above).</p>

<pre>(pc-selection-mode) 
(load &quot;cua-mode&quot;)
(CUA-mode t) </pre>

<h4><a name="Installing Java Tools">Installing Java Tools</a></h4>

<p>The JDEE relies on external tools for compiling, running, and
debugging Java programs. The JDEE specifically supports the Java
Development Kit available at Sun Microsystem's <a
href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/index.html">Java products
&amp; APIs</a> site. The JDEE supports all versions of the JDK.You
can use any other command-line development tool compatible with
those provided by the JDK.<p>

<p>The JDEE works with Jikes, the
Java compiler developed by IBM Corp's alphaWorks. Written in C++,
Jikes is lightening quick, is compatible with Emacs and the other
JDK tools, and is available in Windows as well as Solaris and
Linux versions. Jikes can be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project/">Jikes home
page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> One drawback of Jikes is that the class files that
the current version generates are not compatible with the Java Platform Debug 
Architecture (JPDA) used by the JDEE's debugger, JDEbug. The Jikes team is 
aware of this problem but does not regard fixing it as a priority.</p>


<h4><a name="Installing Cygnus Unix Utilities">Installing Cygwin</a></h4>

<p>This step is optional. You don't need the Cygwin
to run the JDEE. However, you may find some of the utilities
provided by the distribution useful for developing Java
applications, in particular, the ports of the GNU <tt>make</tt>
utility and the <tt>bash</tt> shell. </p>

<ol>
    <li>
      <p>The Cygwin setup program copies the Cygwin distribution
      from the <a href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin site</a> and installs the distribution on your
      system. Click <a href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">here</a>
      to run the setup program.
      </p>
    </li>
   <li>Set up a Unix style directory hierarchy in your Windows
        file system. <p>Cygnus and Emacs have a Unix heritage and
        retain some of their Unix characteristics. You can make
        them feel more at home in a Windows environment by
        providing a Unix style hierarchy. On my system, the
        hierarchy resides on my home directory. It has the
        following structure: </p>
        <p><tt>c:\usr</tt> <br>
        &nbsp; <tt>home</tt> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>emacs</tt> </p>
        <p>Following Unix tradition, I use the home directory to
        store my Emacs and bash startup files. (bash is a Unix
        shell that comes with the Cygwin distribution. I
        recommend that you use bash in place of the native
        Windows shell, command or cmd.) My home directory
        includes a subdirectory named <tt>emacs</tt>. I use this
        to store add-on software packages for Emacs that do not
        come with the NT/Emacs distribution, such as the psgml
        package and gnuserv.
	
	<p><strong>Note</strong> Using a separate directory to store
           add-on packages simplifies upgrading Emacs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Set your system's path to include the directory containing
        Cygwin  executables.
        
       <p>For example, suppose that you
        installed Cygwin on your d drive. You should then update
        the path in your autoexec.bat file (on Windows 95) or
        Environment variables panel (on Windows/NT) to point to </p>
        <p><code>d:\Cygwin\bin</code> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Define a <code>HOME</code> environment variable that points to your
        home directory (<code>c:\usr\home</code>). <p>For example, on Windows
        95, enter the following in your <code>autoexec.bat</code>
        file: </p>
        <p><tt>set home=c:/usr/home</tt> </p>
        <p>Emacs, Cygwin, and other expatriate Unix tools use
        this variable to find your home directory. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Create a bash startup file in your home directory. <p>Use
        any text editor to create the file. Then save it in your
        home directory under the name <tt>.bashrc</tt>. The
        following is my <tt>.bashrc</tt> file, which I copied
        from a bash expert and modified slightly. I don't
        understand it fully, as I am no bash expert myself, and I
        suspect that some of it does not even apply to a Windows
        environment. However, it works, and that's good enough
        for me. </p>

<h4><a name="Installing the JDE">Installing the JDE</a></h4>

<p>Installing the JDEE entails downloading the JDEE distribution,
unpacking it into a directory on your filesystem, and configuring
Emacs to run the JDEE. The following details these steps. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Download the Windows version of the JDEE distribution (see&nbsp;
        <a href="rootpage.html#Downloading">Downloading the JDE</a>).
        <p>The JDEE Windows distribution file is a standard
        Windows zip file that contains the JDEE directory and its
        contents. You can use any Windows unzip program to unzip
        the JDEE. </p>
    </li>

    <li>Unzip the JDEE into your Emacs add-on package directory.</li>
    <br><br>

   <li>
      Download the latest versions of Eric Ludlam's speedbar
      and semantic bovinator packages and install them on your system, 
      each in their own directory.

      <p>You can download these packages from 
         <a href="http://cedet.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.
      </p>

       <p><strong>Note</strong> Emacs and XEmacs include earlier versions of speedbar
         that are incompatible with the JDEE. You must delete the earlier version or
         ensure that it is not on the Emacs load path. Otherwise you will get a Lisp error 
         when trying to start Emacs.
       </p>

    </li>

    </li>

    <li>
      Download the Emacs Lisp library package from the JDE website in
      in <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.tar.gz">compressed
      tar</a> or <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.zip">zip</a>
      format. Uncompress and install the package in a convenient
      location, for example, in your Emacs site directory.<br><br>
      </li>

    <li>Update the Emacs Lisp load path.

        <p>You must tell Emacs where the JDEE and its required packages live. 
           You can do this by adding Lisp forms to
           your Emacs startup (<code>.emacs</code>) file that update the Emacs
           load-path variable, which lists the paths that Emacs
           searches when looking for Lisp packages required by
           commands that you execute. The following is an example of
           how to do this.</p>
        
        <p>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/jde/lisp"))</code><br>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/semantic"))</code><br>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/speedbar"))</code><br>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/elib"))</code><br>
	  <code>(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs/site/eieio"))</code><br>
        </p>

    </li>


    <li>Tell Emacs to load the JDEE at startup. <p>To ensure this,
        add the following lines to your <code>.emacs</code> file: 
</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">(require 'jde)</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Be sure to add this line after the line that updates
        the load path (see step 3 above). </p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>  See <a href="_emacs_jde">minimal .emacs
        file</a> for an example of the minimal setup file
        required to run the JDEE with Emacs. </p>

    </li>

    <li>Compile the JDEE's Lisp files.

        <p>
          <strong>Note </strong> You do not have to compile the JDEE Lisp files
          to use the JDEE. However, compiling the files can reduce Emacs startup
          time and speed some operations.
        </p>

	<p>The JDEE command <code>jde-compile-jde</code> compiles the JDEE Lisp code.
	   It is the easiest way to compile the JDEE Lisp.
	</p>

        <p>
	  The JDEE's lisp directory contains a makefile that compiles the JDEE
          Lisp files.  The makefile assumes that you are using GNU Emacs
	  and that the packages required by the JDEE are installed in the same 
          directory as the JDEE package itself, i.e., the makefile assumes a directory
          structure similar to the following:
	</p>

<p>
<pre>
  site
    jde
    speedbar
    semantic
    elib
    eieio
</pre>
</p>
	<p>
	  If your installation does not fit these assumptions, edit the makefile to reflect
          your installation.
        </p>

	<p>
	  You can specify the path to Emacs or XEmacs on the commmand line, i.e., 
	</p>
<p>
<pre>
make EMACS=d:/Applications/XEmacs/XEmacs-21.1/i386-pc-win32/xemacs
</pre>
</p>
    </li>

</ol>

<h4><a name="SpecifyingBrowser">Specifying a Browser</a></h4>

    <p>The JDEE delegates the task of displaying HTML documents, such
       as <i>The JDEE User's Guide</i>, to <tt>browse-url</tt>, Emacs'
       generic interface to HTML browsers. The default browse-url
       browser in the latest version of NT/Emacs is the Windows
       default HTML browser. The default browse-url browser on Unix
       systems is Netscape. You can customize browse-url to use other
       browsers by executing <tt>M-x customize-group
       browse-url</tt> and editing and saving the appropriate 
       configuration variables.</p>

     <p><b>Note</b> The Windows version of <tt>browse-url</tt> uses
       the default action associated with the html file type on your
       system to display a URL (execute <tt>C-h f
       w32-shell-execute</tt> for more information).  You can thus
       configure <tt>browse-url</tt> indirectly by configuring the default
       Windows action for html files. To do this, select
       <b>View->Folder Options</b> on the Windows/NT or Windows 95
       Explorer menu (note we're talking about the <i>file</i>, not
       the <i>Internet</i> Explorer). For example, when you install
       Internet Explorer, the setup program for Internet Explorer
       defines actions for opening HTML files in an existing window or
       a new window, respectively. You can set either of these as the default open
       action, according to your preference.</p>
  
	<p><b>Note</b> You can configure versions of NT/Emacs 
        earlier than 20.4 to use the default Windows browser. For
        more information, see <a
	href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html#browse-url">shellex</a>
	and the <a href="trouble-shooting.htm">JDE Troubleshooting Guide</a>). However,
        you can get the same result with far less effort simply 
        by upgrading to the latest version of NT/Emacs.</p>

<h3><a name="XEmacs Setup">XEmacs Setup</a></h3>

<p>The XEmacs distribution includes a version of the JDE (usually not the latest). If you want to use this version, you must select it during XEmacs installation or afterwards, using XEmacs' Manage Packages command.</p>

<p>If you have installed the version of the JDE that came with the XEmacs distribution and it is out of date, which is usually the case, you may want to install the latest version. To install the latest version of the JDEE:

<ol>
<li>
   Unzip the JDEE distribution in any convenient directory on your system.
   <br><br>
</li>
<li>
   Delete or rename the ..XEmacs/xemacs-packages/etc/jde directory created by the XEmacs package installer.
<p>This step is crucial. The JDEE package includes both Lisp and nonLisp files. XEmacs and the standard JDE distribution have different ideas about where to store these files. The XEmacs installer stores the JDEE's lisp files in the xemacs-packages lisp directory and the JDEE's non-lisp files in the xemacs-packages etc directory. By contrast, the JDEE distribution stores its lisp files and non-lisp files in various subdirectories of the directory where the JDE distribution is unpacked. The JDEE decides where to look for its nonLisp files based on whether the XEmacs/xemacs-packages/etc/jde directory exists. If the directory exists, the JDEE assumes that it was installed by the XEmacs installer and thus looks for its nonLisp files in the etc/jde directory. If the directory does not exist, the JDEE assumes that it was installed manually and thus looks for its nonLisp files in the directory in which it was unpacked. By deleting or renaming the etc/jde directory in the XEmacs hierarchy, you are telling the JDEE that it was manually installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
Follow the instructions given elsewhere in this guide for updating your .emacs file to include the JDEE.
<br><br>
</li>

  <li>
     If you have not already done so, install the XEmacs debug package. 

     <p>The debug package includes the <code>gud</code> package which
     is required by the JDE.</p>

     <p><strong>Note</strong> For help on installing XEmacs packages, choose 
        <strong>Options-&gt;Manage Packages-&gt;Help</strong> from the XEmacs menubar.
