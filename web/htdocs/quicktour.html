<h1>JDEE Quick Tour</h1>

<p>The following is a quick tour of the JDEE, illustrating some of
its capabilities.</p>

<h2>Compiling a Class</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows the JDEE after compilation
of a class.</p>

<p><img src="images/jde_compile_error.gif"</p>

<p>The upper buffer shows the Java source for the class.
The lower buffer shows the output of the javac compiler. Note the
error line. You can jump to the source of the error by clicking
on the highlighted portion of the error line in the compilation
buffer. This screenshot also show the JDE mode menu, with its
associated key bindings.</p> 

<h2>Running an Application</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows the JDEE window after an
application has been run. The upper buffer shows one of the
classes that makes up the application. The lower buffer is the
application interaction buffer. The standard output of the
application appears in this buffer. Text that you type in this
buffer is piped to the standard input of the application.</p>

<h2>Debugging an Application</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows the JDEE during a debugging
session.</p>

<p><img src="images/jde_debug.gif"></p>

<p>The upper window shows the debugger menu and the cursor
pointing to the line at which the debugger is currently stopped.
The middle window displays the values of local variables. It
is automatically updated as you step through a program. The
lower windows displays debugger status messages.</p>

<h2>Browsing Source Code</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows the Emacs Code Browser (ECB) being
used with the JDEE.</p>

<p><img src="images/ecb.gif"></p>

<p>The column of windows at the left provide you with a heirarchical
view of your project's source directories, files, fields and methods,
respectively. Clicking on any object (directory, file, class, method,
or field) in these windows displays the corresponding object in the
source window. The bottom window displays compiler messages and
other status information.</p>

<h2>Code Completion</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows a code completion menu.</p>

<p><img src="images/completion.gif"></p>

<p>Typing <code>C-c C-v C-.</code> completes the method or field name
at point if there is only one possible completion. If multiple completions
are possible, the JDEE displays a menu of the possible completions. Selecting
an item causes the JDEE to use the selection to complete the field or
method at point.</p>
