       Welcome to the home of the  JDEE, an add-on software package that turns
       Emacs into a comprehensive system for creating, editing,
       debugging, and documenting Java applications. This site aims
       to provide you with complete information on downloading and
       installing the JDEE and obtaining technical support. The
       JDEE maintainers would like to thank <a href= 
      "http://sunsite.dk">SunSITE Denmark</a> for serving as the
       JDEE's host for many years. JDEE is now in the process of
       moving to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdee/">
       sourceforge</a>.
    </p>

     <p><b>Note</b> For additional information on installing
     and using the JDEE, see

    <h2>
       About the JDEE
    </h2>
    <p>
       The JDEE is a software  package that interfaces Emacs to
      command-line Java development tools (for example, JavaSoft's
      JDK). JDEE features include:
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
        JDEE menu with compile, run, debug, build, browse, project,
        and help commands
      </li>
      <li>
        syntax coloring
      </li>
      <li>
        auto indentation
      </li>
      <li>
        compile error to source links
      </li>
      <li>
        source-level debugging
      </li>
      <li>
        source code browsing
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Java source interpreter (Pat Neimeyer's BeanShell)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The JDEE supports both Emacs (Unix and Windows versions) and
      XEmacs. It is freely available under the GNU public license.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> Windows 2000 has a bug that hangs JDEbug, the JDEE's debugger.
    To run JDEbug on Windows 2000, you must install Service Pack 2, which
    fixes the bug.</p>
    <p>
       See <a href="quicktour.html">JDEE Quick Tour</a> for a quick
      tour of the JDEE's capabilities.

    <h2>
       <a name="JDEE Requirements"></a>JDEE Requirements
    </h2>
    <p>
       The JDEE requires the following software:
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
        <p>
	The latest version of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Emacs</a> or
	<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>
	on Unix platforms; <a href= 
	"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html">
	NT/Emacs</a> on Windows platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
	The JDEE works with previous minor versions of Emacs and
	XEmacs 20. However, technical support is provided only
	for the latest versions.
        </p>
     </li>
      
      <li>
	<p>The latest version of the
	<a href="http://cedet.sourceforge.net" >Collection of Emacs 
	Development Environment Tools (CEDET)</a> developed by Eric
	Ludlam
	</p>
      </li>
      
    <li>
        <p>The Emacs Lisp library (elib) package. You can download the package
           in <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.tar.gz">compressed tar</a> or <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/elib-1.0.zip">zip</a>
           format from the JDEE web site.

          Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> or compatible set of Java
          development tools (compiler, virtual machine, debugger,
          class libraries, etc.)
        </p>
      </li>

          a Browser</a> for information on configuring Emacs to use
          a browser.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
        <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">bash</a> or
        other Unix-style shell highly recommended for Windows95/NT
        environments.
      </li>

    <p>
       If you have a problem with the JDEE, first check the <a href= 
      "trouble-shooting.htm">JDEE Troubleshooting Guide</a>. Next
      make sure that you have installed the latest version of the
      JDEE and the latest versions of the packages required by JDEE
      on your system. Also, make sure that that system path and the
      Emacs load-path variables list the paths to the required
      packages. Most problems reported by users are
      installation/setup problems.
    </p>
    <p>
       Installing Emacs packages can be tricky, especially for
      Emacs novices. If you are inexperienced, try finding a local
      Emacs guru to help you. You may also be able to get help
      installing supporting packages by sending messages to the <a
      href="mailto:jde@sunsite.dk">JDEE mailing list</a> or
      posting messages to the Emacs help newsgroup
      (gnu.emacs.help).
    </p>
    <p>
      If after you have installed the required packages, you still
      have a problem running the JDEE, please send your problem
      report (see <a href="rootpage.html#RequestingHelp">Requesting Help</a>),
      preferably, to the <a href="mailto:jde@sunsite.dk">JDEE
      mailing list</a> or, if you are not on the list, to <a href= 
      "mailto:paulk@mathworks.com">Paul Kinnucan</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong> I generally cc the JDEE list on my replies
    to JDEE-related mail sent to me personally. I do this if I feel the
    reply may be useful to other JDEE users in the hope that it will
    save me from having to repeat the information later. The copied
    reply generally include quotes from the original mail. If you
    do not want me to cc the JDEE list, please include a note to this effect
    at the head of your mail.

    <h3>
       <a name="RequestingHelp"></a>Requesting Help
    </h3>
    <p>
       When requesting help, it is important that you provide a
      complete, detailed description of the problem and the
      Emacs/JDEE environment in which it occurs. That way, you will
      avoid wasting precious time communicating potentially vital
      information needed to help you. Also, please do not make the
      mistake of assuming that you know what information is
      necessary to solve a problem. If you knew, you would not be
      asking for help, right? Nearly all the JDEE problems that I
      have seen are caused by faulty setups. Because Emacs is an
      open, extensible system, runs on many platforms, and allows
      unlimited customization, no two Emacs/JDEE setups are alike.
      Thus, when asking for help, it is particularly vital that you
      supply a complete description of your Emacs/JDEE environment,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
	<p>
        host platform (e.g., Windows/NT, Solaris, Linux, etc.)
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        JDEE version (e.g., JDEE 2.0)
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        Emacs version (e.g., NT/Emacs 20.7.1)
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        <i>complete</i> contents of your <code>.emacs</code> file. 
	</p>
        <p>
           <b>Note</b> Please do not make the common mistake of
          sending only the so-called "JDEE-related" part of an
          .emacs file. Settings in the omitted portion may conflict
          in subtle ways with the JDEE portion. Many Emacs users,
          especially novices, copy all or parts of their .emacs
          files from other sources without taking pains to
          understand the copied portions. When reporting a
          JDEE problem, the owner typically omits the borrowed
          sections as not "relevant" to the JDEE. Often, on the
          contrary, it is precisely the omitted portion that is the
          culprit.
        </p>
        <p>
           By the way, <code>.emacs</code> files are highly personal things. The
          easiest way for an Emacs newcomers to get into hot water
          is to borrow some grizzled veteran's overgrown, crufty
          .emacs file. An Emacs novice would do better to start
          with a blank slate, adding to it gradually and
          making sure to understand each addition completely, as it
          is added.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
	<p>
        Contents of the backtrace buffer if an error occurs.
	</p>
	<p>If the the Lisp variable <code>debug-on-error</code>
	is <code>t</code> when an error occurs,
	 Emacs opens a buffer listing the 
	sequence of Lisp function calls that led to the error.
	This is known as a backtrace. A backtrace often is
	enough to determine the cause of an error. You thus
	should <i>always</i> include it if it occurs.</p>

	<p> To get a backtrace, you
           must set the Lisp variable <code>debug-on-error</code>
	   to <code>t</code> <i>before</i>
	   the error occurs. The best way to do this is to put the
	   form  <code>(setq debug-on-error t)</code> in your 
	   <code>.emacs</code> file and restart Emacs.
	</p>

      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
          Contents of the <code>*messages*</code> buffer <i>immediately
	  after</i> the error occurred.
	</p>

	<p><b>Note</b> The <code>*messages*</code> buffer is called
           the "message log" on XEmacs. To display the message log,
	   execute the command <code>show-message-log</code>.	
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>
        Contents of the <code>*JDEEbug*</code> buffer if you are having problems
        with JDEEbug
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
        Contents of the <code>prj.el</code> file for the project in which the
        problem occurred.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       If the problem occurs during startup, rerun Emacs, using the
      -debug-init command line switch. This causes Emacs to stop
      when an error occurs in your .emacs file and display the
      resulting backtrace in the backtrace buffer. Include the
      backtrace in your problem report.</p>
      <p>The JDEE includes a
       <b>JDE->Help->Submit Problem Report</b> command that creates a complete 
       snapshot of your system. If the error occurs after the JDEE is loaded,
       you can use this command to generate all the information you need
       to include in the problem report.      
    </p>

       The JDEE itself does not have any date dependencies.
      However, the JDEE requires other software packages that
      may have date dependencies. The required packages include
      Emacs, a Java compiler and debugger (e.g., those provided by
      JavaSoft's Java Development Kit), and a web browser. See
